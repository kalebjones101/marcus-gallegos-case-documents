# Alabama Justice Watchdog — Media Resources

## Case Overview (Journalist Summary)

On November 18, 2025, Marcus Gallegos was arrested in Hanceville, Alabama by an Alabama Highway Patrol trooper. Alabama Justice Watchdog (ALJW) believes the arrest was unlawful and involved violations of constitutional rights.

This repository collects primary-source materials related to the arrest, subsequent public records requests, and related civic activity. Materials are provided to assist journalists, editors, and the public in independently reviewing the facts.

Mr. Gallegos’s first court appearance is scheduled for January 13, 2025, at the Cullman County Courthouse.

A lawful, peaceful public gathering is planned outside the courthouse on that date to raise awareness and observe the proceedings.
