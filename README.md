## Source & provenance

Alabama Justice Watchdog (ALJW) distinguishes between device-original recordings, third-party copies, and recordings derived from public government livestreams.

- Some audio and video files were recorded directly by ALJW. In those instances, ALJW retains the device-original recordings in their native format.
- Some media files were provided to ALJW by Marcus Gallegos. These files were received as copies and, in some cases, renamed to fit ALJW naming conventions. ALJW does not possess the device-original versions of those recordings.
- Some recordings consist of screen captures made by ALJW from publicly available government livestreams (such as county commission meetings). In those cases, the original recordings are controlled by the originating government entity.

All media is presented as received or recorded. No substantive edits have been made unless explicitly disclosed.

## Access to source media files

Access to source or original media files is handled on a case-by-case basis and depends on the provenance of the file.

- Device-original recordings created by ALJW may be available for review
- Files provided to ALJW by third parties are available only in the form received
- Recordings derived from government livestreams remain under the control of the originating government entity

Due to file size, integrity, and chain-of-custody considerations, source media files are not distributed publicly.

Attorneys, journalists, and other qualified reviewers may request access for verification or review purposes.

Requests should include:
- Name and affiliation
- Purpose of the request
- Intended use of the material
