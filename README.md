## Source & provenance

Alabama Justice Watchdog (ALJW) distinguishes between device-original recordings, third-party copies, and recordings derived from public government livestreams.

- Some audio and video files were recorded directly by ALJW. In those instances, ALJW retains the device-original recordings in their native format.
- Some media files were provided to ALJW by Marcus Gallegos. These files were received as copies and, in some cases, renamed to fit ALJW naming conventions. ALJW does not possess the device-original versions of those recordings.
- Some recordings consist of screen captures made by ALJW from publicly available government livestreams (such as county commission meetings). In those cases, the original recordings are controlled by the originating government entity.

All media is presented as received or recorded. No substantive edits have been made unless explicitly disclosed.
