## Source & Provenance of Media Files

ALJW maintains transparency regarding the source and handling of all media referenced in this index.

Media files fall into the following categories:

- **Device-original recordings created by ALJW**  
  Some audio and video recordings were created directly by Alabama Justice Watchdog using ALJW-controlled devices. In these instances, ALJW retains the device-original files in their native format.

- **Copies provided by Marcus Gallegos**  
  Some recordings (including dashcam or Attorney Shield–related audio/video) were provided to ALJW by Marcus Gallegos. These files were received as copies. ALJW does not possess the device-original recordings for these files. Files may have been renamed to fit ALJW naming conventions, but no substantive edits were made.

- **Government meeting recordings**  
  Some recordings consist of screen captures made by ALJW from publicly available government livestreams (e.g., Cullman County Commission meetings). The original livestream recordings are controlled by the respective government entity.

## Access to Original or Source Media Files

Original or source media files are not distributed publicly due to file size, integrity, and chain-of-custody considerations.

Attorneys, journalists, or other qualified reviewers may request access to available source media files for verification or review purposes.

Requests should include:
- Name and affiliation
- Purpose of the request
- Intended use of the material

Requests may be directed to:

Where applicable, SHA-256 hashes are provided to allow file integrity verification upon receipt.
